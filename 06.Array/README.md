### Summary
- Basic Array Declaration and Initialization
- Accessing Array Elements
- Iterating Over an Array
  - Using for Loop
  - Using range Loop
- Multi-Dimensional Arrays
- Passing Arrays to Functions
  - By Value : When you pass an array to a function, it is passed by value, meaning a copy of the array is passed.
  - By Reference (Using Slices) : If you want to avoid copying the array, you can pass a slice instead.
- Array of Pointers : You can create an array of pointers to elements of a specific type.
- Advanced Usage: Copying and Comparing Arrays
  - Copying Arrays : You can copy arrays by simply assigning one to another since arrays are value types.
  - Comparing Arrays : You can compare arrays using the == operator, which checks if all elements are equal.
