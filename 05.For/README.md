# For
### Summary
- Basic for Loop : A basic for loop in Go looks similar to other languages
- Infinite for Loop : An infinite loop can be created using for without any conditions
- for as a while Loop : You can use for in Go to mimic a while loop
- Iterating Over a Slice : You can use the for loop to iterate over elements in a slice
- Using range to Iterate Over a Slice or Array : The range keyword simplifies iteration over slices, arrays, maps, and strings
- Iterating Over a Map : You can use range to iterate over the keys and values of a map
- Iterating Over a String : Using range to iterate over a string gives you the index and the Unicode code point of each character
- Nested for Loops : You can nest for loops to iterate over multidimensional data structures
- Using continue and break : You can control the flow of the loop using continue to skip an iteration or break to exit the loop
- Using Labels with for Loops : Labels can be used to break or continue outer loops
